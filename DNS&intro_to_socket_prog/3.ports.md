Ports

in mern we bind the server with a port but why not the client side(frontend)?
if an application is talking over a network we have to have ports, so if we are not doing it someone else is

Ephemeral(temporary) ports

Scenario 1(both client and server have ports)(only 1 tab is open)

browser(0.0.0.0:80) -> google server(1.1.1.1:50) 

dest:1.1.1.1:50
src:0.0.0.0:80

google server(1.1.1.1:50) -> browser(0.0.0.0:80)
src:1.1.1.1:50
dest:0.0.0.0:80

in this case everything is fine browser sent request to google, google sent back request data packet and os took it and gave it to browser

Scenario 2(multiple tabs are open and tabs send request to diff servers)

there are multiple tabs sends requets to different servers with same source, when the data eventually comes back will the os be able to differentiate which packet is for which tab? yes as the source on the response is different

Scenario 3(multiple tabs are open and tabs send request to same server)

but now since multiple tabs sends requets to same destinations with same source , now will os be able to differentiate b/w tabs?os differentiates using src ip,src port, dest ip, dest port but if all of these are same such as this case os gets confused where to send what

The way os solves this is that dont bind frontend/client to a port, any time there is an outgoing connection, os assigns a temporary port for connection and destroys it once response comes back

### Why can't 0.0.0.0 be assigned?
0.0.0.0 is not a regular IP address. It's a special meta-address that means "all available IP addresses on this machine." A server process can bind to 0.0.0.0 to listen for incoming connections on any network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet) that the computer has. It's used for listening, not for communicating as a source or destination.

### How many ports can you have?
There are 65,535 possible ports for both TCP and UDP.
Ports 0 to 1023: These are the Well-Known Ports, reserved for standard services (like HTTP, FTP, SSH).
Ports 1024 to 49151: These are Registered Ports for specific applications.
Ports 49152 to 65535: This is the Ephemeral Port range that operating systems use to assign temporary ports to clients.

### Does the OS "destroy" the port?
Your phrasing is very close. The OS doesn't destroy the port itself, but it closes the connection and releases the ephemeral port, making it available for another application to use in the future. The port number itself continues to exist, but the specific communication channel associated with it is terminated.
