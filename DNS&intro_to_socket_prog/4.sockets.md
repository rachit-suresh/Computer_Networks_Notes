Sockets

software endpoints that enable comms b/w processes across a network

sockets are interfaces that wrap ip address, ports, protocols, etc and manages all these complexities during network comms and gives data back


2 types(these sockets being strictly tcp and udp is not 100 percet true since in py socket() method it asks us the type and the protocol as parameter, if stream = tcp and datagram = udp, why would it ask that?so the name just means how the data flows in stream sockets as a stream(continuous) and we can attach any protocol with it, tcp is just the default for stream)
Stream Sockets (TCP): Provide a reliable, connection-oriented, and ordered stream of data. This is the most common type, used for services like web browsing (HTTPS) and email (SMTP).

Datagram Sockets (UDP): Provide a connectionless and unreliable service. Packets may be lost or arrive out of order. This is used for services where speed is critical, like DNS queries or live video streaming.

### Server Workflow
The server's job is to set up a permanent doorway and wait for clients to knock. Your notes are correct.
  socket(): Create the socket endpoint. (Build the door).
  bind(): Assign a specific address (IP and port number) to the socket. (Label the door with your apartment number, e.g., 443).
  listen(): Put the socket in "listening mode" and create a queue for incoming connection requests. (Hang an "Open for Business" sign on the door).
  accept(): This call blocks (waits) until a client tries to connect. When a client's connect() request arrives, the 3-way handshake is completed, the connection is established, and accept() returns a new socket that is dedicated to communicating with that specific client.
  receive() / send(): Use the new socket to exchange data with the client.
  close(): Terminate the connection with the client and release the socket.

In the server side, we first create a socket using socket() and then use bind() to assign an ip addres, but wy do we aassign the ip address, if its a port then okay understandable but shouldnt the ip of the server be the ip address?
The system has multiple ip addresses and multiple network interfaces like ethernet,localhost(loop back interface)(127.0.0.1) etc and each interface has thier own ip associated with them


### Client Workflow
The client's job is to find the server's door and initiate a conversation. Your notes had one extra function, listen(), which is only used by servers.
  socket(): Create the socket endpoint. (Build your own temporary door).
  connect(): This is the key client function. It attempts to establish a connection with the server at its specific IP and port. This single function initiates and completes the TCP 3-way handshake from the client's side. The operating system assigns an ephemeral port to the client socket automatically.
  send() / receive(): Exchange data with the server.
  close(): Terminate the connection and release the socket.
